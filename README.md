**Weighted directed graphs**

In this task, interfaces of:

**1.** Interface of a weighted graph DirectedWeightedGraph

**2.** Algorithm interface on graphs (weighted tuner). DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithms


**myNode:**

A class that contains all the nodes' data.

**myEdge:** 

A class that contains all the data of the edges.

**gl:**

A class that contains the coordinates of the nodes.

**DWG**

class representing a directional weighted graph,
            Class object:
             HashNode - All nodes
             Hashedge - All edges
             inNode - All incoming edges from the k node.
             outNode - All edges exit k
             sizeNode = The number of nodes in the graph
             sizeEdge = The number of edges in a graph
       

**DWGA:**

A class that implements the DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithms interface
Class object:
DirectedWeightedGraph dwg- Represents a graph.

**GUIG:**
MYFrame A class that extends JFrame implements ActionListener
This class creates a screen that displays the graph along with the operations of save, load, run and set
MYPanal extends JPanel This class uses graphis and it draws the vertices and sides of the graph for us
