**Weighted directed graphs**

In this task, interfaces of:
**1.** Interface of a weighted graph DirectedWeightedGraph
**2.** Algorithm interface on graphs (weighted tuner). DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithms


**myNode:**

A class that contains all the nodes' data.

**myEdge:** 

A class that contains all the data of the edges.

**gl:**

A class that contains the coordinates of the nodes.

**DWG**

class representing a directional weighted graph,
            Class object:
             HashNode - All nodes
             Hashedge - All edges
             inNode - All incoming edges from the k node.
             outNode - All edges exit k
             sizeNode = The number of nodes in the graph
             sizeEdge = The number of edges in a graph
       

**DWGA:**

A class that implements the DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithms interface
Class object:
DirectedWeightedGraph dwg- Represents a graph.

Graph size 1000:
